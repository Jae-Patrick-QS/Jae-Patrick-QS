- Hi I'm Jaedyn Quinlan-Sadler
- Generally speaking I have an interest in computers due to my exposure to early modern PC gaming from a young age.
- As a result I have an interest in programming given how it functions as the skeleton for every video game, no matter how simple. Like a nervous system.
- On top of this, I usually enjoy the other type of writing, that being liteary and worldbuilding writing as a hobby, and of course video games too.
- I mainly prefer strategy games like the ones made by Paradox Interactive, though I do also have preferences for games like Helldivers 2, Ready or Not, or Garry's Mod, to name a few.
